###In a dense forest, there once lived a timid rabbit###
One afternoon, he was dozing off under a coconut tree. In his sleep, the rabbit saw a strange dream. It was dark and gloomy. The clouds fought with each other and the mountains roared mightily. The world was breaking into pieces Just then a big coconut fell from the tree, right behind the rabbit’s head. “Thud!” came the sound.... and the rabbit woke up, howling, his heart, missing a beat.
		In his fear, he felt as if his dream had come true and the world was breaking into pieces. So scared he became that he did not even turn back to see what had fallen. “The sky has fallen, the world is breaking!” so shouting, the poor creature ran as fast as he could. Some distance away, a deer was grazing. “What’s the matter, O Rabbit ?” he asked. The rabbit gasped. “Don’t ask questions. Run for your life, the sky has fallen!” Hearing this, the deer joined the rabbit. Some miles away, a buffalo saw them. He asked the reason for their panic. The deer called out to him, “Run, run.... the world is breaking!”
		And now the buffalo ran too. Further, they met an elephant and learning the reason for their plight, the elephant ran too. Soon the bull, the jackal, the bear, the horse...all were running blindly, shouting with fear. The galloping animals kicked up thick clouds of dust the sound of so many hoofs together was adding to the gloom and fear.
